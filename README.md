# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## To Do:
1) A brief description of the project. You can use the project brief or your README file as inspiration. In your description, try also to reflect on your work by answering the following questions (you don't need too much detail; the key points are fine):
- What was your role for this project and what tasks did you face?
- What decisions did you take and why? What were the consequences?
- If you could, what would you do differently?
- What lessons did you learn during this project?
2) A screenshot to represent the project.
3) A link to the project’s GitHub repository.
4) A link to the live, hosted version of your app (if possible). If you don’t have a live version, include screenshots that show the app’s functionality or a recording of your app in use.
5) A list of the technologies used for each project (React, CSS etc. — again, you can pull this from your README file).
6) Any other relevant materials you created for the project; for example, user flows, user stories, and/or a Kanban board. Be sure to explain how you worked with these materials during the project.
